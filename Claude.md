# Instructions for Claude

## Documentation Policy
- **DO NOT create new documentation files** for every change or fix
- **UPDATE existing docs** (README.md) instead
- Only create new docs if absolutely necessary (new major feature, separate guide, etc.)
- Keep documentation consolidated and easy to find

## Camera App Development Notes
- The cameras are fragile and break easily if resources aren't managed properly
- Always test changes thoroughly before considering them "fixed"
- Photo capture must pause/resume preview to avoid resource conflicts
- Don't assume things work until user confirms
